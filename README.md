# simple-evolutionary-computation

This small project is an implementation from scratch in Python (I used Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib) of the **Ant Colony Optimization** evolutionary algorithm for the Data Design and Nature-Inspired Computing course of University of Ca' Foscari in Venice.

The repo contains the code, the report and slides.
